OBJECTIVE:

This project is a Campus Events & Ticketing Web Application designed to help students discover, organize, and attend events on campus. The project will be designed with the needs of three users in mind, the students, organizers, and administrators.


The objectives of this project will thus be to:
1. Enable students to search, save, and attend campus events.
2. Provide organizers with event management tools (creation, ticketing, analytics).
3. Equip administrators with oversight and moderation features.
4. Improve transparency and engagement through analytics and dashboards.
